A simple CRUD App used for review with minimal Styling. Mostly used to explore the functionality of the CRUD process of a small-full stack application.

Refreshed knowledge of older CRUD syntax; chaining promises, along with usage of MONGODB. If i were to return to this in the future, i would update the code with the usage of ASYNC/AWAIT and use Mongoose instead.

Idea/Guide for this app was taken from :
